Gradient projection method and method of successive average (MSA) is compared relating to the efficiency of solving user equilibrium problem. The gradient projection has the most fast convergence rate, and its convergence criterion can be satisfied in the first five iterations. The gap is monotonous descent in the algorithm appeared in our TRB paper, though the rate is slower than the gradient projection. Whereas, the method of successive average not only has a very slow convergence rate but also the gap has some fluctuation. Fortunately, the fluctuation is more and more stable. However, the method of successive average can be performed easily.
